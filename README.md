# Technologies used

# Getting Started

## You start this game with 50 points.
    - If you score 100 points, you win. A sound effect and specific message will indicate a winning round.
    - If your score hits 0 points, you lose. A sound effect and specific message will indicate a losing round.

## Click the 'Explore' button to play.
    - An event will be randomly generated with each click of the Explore button.
    - An image will pop up on the screen each time Explore button is clicked.
    - Each image has a numeric value. 
    - Your score will either increase or decrease depending on the numeric value of most recent image shown.
    - The Explore button will be disabled for 3.5 seconds after each click. This time interval will allow a sound effect to play with each click. 

## Click the 'Reset' button
    - If you win, you may click the Reset button to start the game over.
    - If you lose, you may click the Reset button to start the game over.
    - At any point during the game, you may click the Reset button to start the game over.      

# Next Steps
    - Perhaps I can add more events, or update the game next year so it's a 2022 Year In Review.
